# Product Feedback through Developer Relations – A Framework


## Executive Summary
Elaborate on why feedback from DevRel is more important than internal dogfooding, and how mechanisms in feedback processing can contribute to a stronger and more trusted / authentic relationship with developers. 
Feedback and content/documentation are the two key assets that Developer Relations contribute to a product.


## Description
From the three pillars of Developer Relations (relationship management, content and product feedback) product feedback is for sure the most underrated. Yet it is also the most powerful one. External feedback to a product discloses hidden flaws in design, usage and security. It provides a fresh perspective and helps evaluate assumptions. 
This document on gathering and processing product feedback through Developer Relations is meant as a starting point for implementing a process at [company’s name] for improving how external and internal product feedback has the opportunity to contribute to product development. It’s written with a corporate structure in mind, where developer relations is a separate organization in Engineering or Marketing, but many of the key aspects may also apply to organizations where Developer Relations is fragmented into various product groups. 

Focus of this document is the operational details to streamline feedback from internal and external sources.
